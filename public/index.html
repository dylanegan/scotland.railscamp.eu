      <h3>A Technical Retreat in Beautiful Scotland</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="http://railscamps.com">Rails Camp</a> is a different kind of conference: there is no strict schedule or agenda.
        Rails Camp aims to create a wonderful environment in which <strong>people of different backgrounds and experience</strong> can get together, discuss, learn, and hack.
        Rails Camp is a special experience. It's an event detached from your daily environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please join us for Rails Camp Scotland from <strong>September 26 until September 29, 2016</strong>, for a few days full of great, like&ndash;minded people, inspiring conversations, fun hacking, stunning views, laughs, learnings, and delicious, regional food.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference will be held at the lovely <a href="http://comriecroft.com">Comrie Croft</a>, located in Crieff, just outside of Perth, Scotland.
        <strong>Accommodation will be provided</strong>. If you wish to camp, please let <a href="mailto:scotland@railscamp.eu?subject=I 😍 camping!">us</a> know and we'll coordinate with yourself and the venue to ensure everything is arranged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comrie Croft will provide bedding, but please ensure that you <strong>bring a towel and bathroom amenities</strong>.
        And don't forget to pack appropriate clothing, as there are lots of walking trails around the venue to enjoy.
        We'll provide a more complete list of what to bring closer to the date.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be arranging a <strong>return coach service from Perth train station</strong> to Comrie Croft. If you will be making your own way to the venue, please let us know.
        Public transport is also an option, with a bus service stopping at the venue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Meals will be provided</strong>, but please feel free to bring anything extra. There are fridges available for storage and a kitchen available for you to prepare anything you require.
      </p>
      <h3>We Welcome Everyone</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of your skills and background: <strong>we want you there</strong>.
        Who you are, what you do and what you bring to the event doesn’t have to be about Rails or even Ruby!
