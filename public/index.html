      <h3>A Country Retreat in Beautiful Scotland</h3>
      <p>
        Join us for a few days full of great, like&ndash;minded people, inspiring conversations, fun hacking, stunning views, laughs, learnings, and delicious, regional food.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://railscamps.com">Rails Camp</a> is a different kind of conference: there is no strict schedule or agenda.
        Rails Camp aims to create a wonderful environment in which people of different backgrounds and experience can get together, discuss, learn, and hack.
        Rails Camp is a special experience. It's an event detached from your daily environment.
      </p>
      <h3>We Welcome Everyone</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of your skills and background: we want you there.
        Who you are, what you do and what you bring to the event doesnâ€™t even have to be about Rails or Ruby!
        <a href="https://ti.to/rails-camp-scotland/september-2016">Register your interest</a> in Rails Camp Scotland now, and join us in September 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rails Camp Scotland will be a conference that adheres to the <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Conference Code of Conduct</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>About Rails Camp</h3>
      <p>
        Rails Camp first ran in Australia in 2007, organised by the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/genlevel">Ben&nbsp;Askins</a>.
        Now, there are camps throughout the world: from the U.S., to Denmark, Poland, New Zealand, and the UK &mdash; but not <em>yet</em> in Scotland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rails Camp Scotland is put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanegan">Dylan&nbsp;Egan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanfm">Dylan&nbsp;Fogarty&ndash;MacDonald</a>.
