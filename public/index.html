        <h2>About Rails Camp (Scotland)</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://railscamps.com">Rails Camp</a> first ran in Australia in 2007, organised by the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/genlevel">Ben Askins</a>.
          Since then there has been an event twice a year in Australia. There have also been Rails Camps throughout the world, including the UK, but not <em>yet</em> in Scotland.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://railscamps.com">Rails Camp</a> is a different kind of conference. There is no strict schedule (outside of eating times) and everyone is encouraged to participate.
          While Rails, and of course Ruby, are the general focus of the conference, there is no real agenda set. The conference welcomes everyone from varying experience levels and technical backgrounds.
          Rails Camp is more of a name than an agenda. If anything, the agenda is to get people together to discuss, hack and experience a conference detached from the normal environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rails Camp Scotland is currently an idea, put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanegan">Dylan Egan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanfm">Dylan Fogarty-MacDonald</a>.
          With enough interest we hope to proceed with the first Rails Camp in Scotland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rails Camp Scotland will be a conference that adheres to the <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Conference Code of Conduct</a>.
