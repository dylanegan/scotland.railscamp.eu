      <h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
      <p>In order to maximise Rails Camp Scotland joy, please refer to this checklist when packing your bags.</p>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li>
          <b>Clothing</b> &mdash; be sure to include <b>warm clothes</b>, but also entertain the possibility of warm, sunny weather.
          It could be 20º and it could be 3º! If we get both, it wouldn't be unusual. A <b>rain jacket</b> and any other wet weather gear could come in handy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Laptop</b> &mdash; including chargers, <b>UK power adapters</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Toothbrush &amp; Toiletries</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Towel</b> (if you forget, they can be hired for £2 at Comrie Croft)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medications</b> you take regularly
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Snacks</b> that you can’t live without
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Walking gear</b> if you want to go for an explore
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Biking gear</b> if you want to go for a wheeled explore
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data</b> and <b>files</b> etc that you’d normally rely on getting from the Internet. Rails Camp is a time when <code>bundle install</code> and <code>npm install</code> aren't always possible. Also think about <b>documentation</b> that you may need that's usually accessed online. <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" title="Dash documentation app">Dash</a> can be handy here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Camera</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
